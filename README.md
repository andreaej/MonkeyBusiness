# MonkeyBusiness

A local zoo wants to keep track of how many pounds of food each of its three monkeys eats each day during a typical week.  Write a program that stores this information in a two-dimensional 3 x 7 array, where each row represents a different monkey and each column represents a different day of the week.  The program should first have the user input the data for each monkey.  Then it should create a report that includes the following information:

- Average amount of food eaten per day by the whole family of monkeys

- The least amount of food eaten during the week by any one monkey

- The greatest amount of food eaten during the week by any one monkey

Be sure to also show the food eaten each day.

**Input validation:  Do not accept negative numbers for pounds of food eaten.**

## For example:
|   | Sunday | Monday  | Tuesday  | Wednesday  | Thursday  | Friday  | Saturday  |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Monkey1  | 1 | 2 | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  | 7  |
| Monkey2  | 9 | 8 | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 |
| Monkey3  | 0 | 1 | 9 | 2 | 8 | 3 | 7 |

- The average amount of food eaten by the monkeys per day: [3.33, 3.67, 6.33, 4.0, 6.0, 4.33, 5.67]
- The minimum amount of food eaten in the week eaten by any monkey: 0
- The maximum amount of food eaten in the week eaten by any monkey: 9
